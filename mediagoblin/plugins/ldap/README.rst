=============
 ldap plugin
=============

.. Warning:
   This plugin is not compatible with the other authentication plugins.

This plugin allow your GNU Mediagoblin instance to authenticate against an
LDAP server.

Set up the ldap plugin
======================

1. Install the ``python-ldap`` package.

2. Add the following to your MediaGoblin .ini file in the ``[plugins]`` section::

    [[mediagoblin.plugins.ldap]]

Configuring the ldap plugin
===========================

This plugin allows you to use multiple ldap servers for authentication.

In order to configure a server, add the following to you MediaGoblin .ini file
under the ldap plugin:: 

    [[mediagoblin.plugins.ldap]]
    [[[server1]]]
    LDAP_SERVER_URI = 'ldap://ldap.testathon.net:389'
    LDAP_USER_DN_TEMPLATE = 'cn={username},ou=users,dc=testathon,dc=net'
    [[[server2]]]
    ...

Make any necessary changes to the above to work with your sever. Make sure
``{username}`` is where the username should be in LDAP_USER_DN_TEMPLATE.
   
If you would like to fetch the users email from the ldap server upon account
registration, add ``LDAP_SEARCH_BASE = 'ou=users,dc=testathon,dc=net'`` and
``EMAIL_SEARCH_FIELD = 'mail'`` under you server configuration in your
MediaGoblin .ini file.

.. Warning:
   By default, this plugin provides no encryption when communicating with the
   ldap servers. If you would like to use an SSL connection, change
   LDAP_SERVER_URI to use ``ldaps://'' and whichever port you use. Default ldap
   port for SSL connections is 636. If you would like to use a TLS connection,
   add ``LDAP_START_TLS = 'true'`` under your server configuration in your
   MediaGoblin .ini file.
